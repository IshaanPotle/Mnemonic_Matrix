# 🌐 Mnemonic Matrix System - Professor's Guide

## 🎯 **What This System Does**

The Mnemonic Matrix System automatically categorizes academic papers into four matrix dimensions:

1. **⏰ Time Periods (T1-T5)** - Based on **publication date only** (not content discussed)
2. **🎓 Disciplines (DSOC, DHIS, etc.)** - Academic fields and methods
3. **📺 Memory Carriers (MCSO, MCLI, etc.)** - Media and forms of memory transmission
4. **🧠 Concept Tags (CTCollectiveMemory, etc.)** - Memory-related concepts and theories

## 🔑 **Important Feature**

✅ **Timeline tags are now restricted to publication date only**
- T1: 400 BCE to 1859 (Ancient to Early Modern)
- T2: 1860 to 1949 (Modern Period)
- T3: 1950 to 1989 (Post-War Period)
- T4: 1990 to 2010 (Contemporary Period)
- T5: 2011 to Present (Digital Age)

**Before**: Timeline was based on content discussed in the paper
**Now**: Timeline is based ONLY on when the paper was published

## 🌍 **How to Access**

Your student will provide you with a public URL that looks like:
```
https://yourname-mnemonic-matrix.streamlit.app
```

Simply click the link or copy-paste it into your web browser. No technical setup required!

## 📱 **Using the System**

### 1. **Upload Your Papers**
- **BibTeX files**: Upload .bib files directly
- **Manual entry**: Type in paper details one by one
- **JSON format**: Paste paper data in JSON format

### 2. **Auto-Tagging**
- Click "🤖 Auto-tag Papers" to automatically categorize papers
- The system will use ML to predict appropriate tags
- **Timeline tags are automatically set based on publication year**

### 3. **View Results**
- **Visualizations**: See tag distributions and relationships
- **Papers List**: Review all papers with their tags
- **Tag Analysis**: Analyze which tags are most common
- **Timeline**: View papers across time periods
- **Export**: Download results in various formats

## 📊 **Example Output**

When you upload a paper published in 1995:
- **Title**: "Collective Memory in Post-Soviet Societies"
- **Year**: 1995
- **Timeline Tag**: T4 (1990-2010) ← **Based on publication date, not content**
- **Discipline**: DSOC (Sociology)
- **Memory Carrier**: MCME (Memory Scholars)
- **Concept Tags**: CTCollectiveMemory, CTCulturalMemory

## 💡 **Tips for Best Results**

1. **Include publication year** - This ensures accurate timeline tagging
2. **Provide abstracts** - More text = better tag predictions
3. **Check tag descriptions** - Hover over tags to see what they mean
4. **Export results** - Download your tagged papers for further analysis

## 🔧 **If You Encounter Issues**

1. **Website won't load**: Ask your student to restart the system
2. **Tags seem wrong**: Check that publication year is correct
3. **System is slow**: Large numbers of papers may take time to process
4. **Need help**: Contact your student - they can adjust the system

## 📚 **What You Can Do With This**

- **Research Planning**: See gaps in your literature review
- **Collaboration**: Share tagged papers with colleagues
- **Grant Applications**: Demonstrate systematic literature coverage
- **Teaching**: Show students how to categorize academic work
- **Publication**: Use tags in your own papers for consistency

## 🎉 **Getting Started**

1. **Wait for the public URL** from your student
2. **Open the URL** in your web browser
3. **Upload your papers** (BibTeX files work best)
4. **Click auto-tag** to categorize everything
5. **Explore the visualizations** and results
6. **Export your tagged papers** for further use

**Timeline Restriction**: Remember, timeline tags (T1-T5) are now based on publication date only, addressing your specific feedback about restricting them to when papers were published rather than what they discuss.
